### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Shruti 

I'm a Computer Science Engineering Undergrad interested in Web Development. I can work on HTML, CSS, JavaScript and am trying to get hands on experience at VueJS.

Other than web development, I'm practicing JAVA consistently and building my programming skill and logic. 

I'm also interested in digital art and designing. I'm an approved phone wallpaper creator at Zedge (sabreenshruti).
